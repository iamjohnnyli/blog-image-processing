# Blog Image Processing Automation Script

This is the one of the functions for my personal FastAPI server. It automates the process of cropping, resizing, adding author's information, compressing, and uploading an image.

- The compressing service I use [tinypng](https://tinypng.com)
- The storage for image I use [sm.ms](https://doc.sm.ms/)
- The image resource I use [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/documentation)

## Usage

Please create smms.txt to store sm.ms API key, create tiny.txt to store tinypng.com API Key, and create ca.txt to store upsplash.com API key.

This is the submodule for my FastAPI server.
